## Easy

### question 1

Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. 

```{r two-plus-1a, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r two-plus-1a-hint-1}
"use desc( ))"
```
```{r two-plus-1a-solution}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```
```{r two-plus-1a-check}
gradethis::grade_code()
```


## Modrate 

### question 2

write the code to find the Flights that left the earliest.

```{r two-plus-2a, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r two-plus-2a-hint-1}
"the code looks similiar to the answer of question 1"
```
```{r two-plus-2a-solution}
arrange(flights, dep_delay)
```
```{r two-plus-2a-check}
gradethis::grade_code()
```


## Hard

### question 3

show top 10 flights that traveled the farthest and top 10 that traveled the shortest?

```{r two-plus-3a, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r two-plus-3a-hint-1}
"The answer follows the same idea as the answer for number 1 and 2"
```
```{r two-plus-3a-solution}
arrange(flights, desc(distance))
arrange(flights, distance)
```
```{r two-plus-3a-check}
gradethis::grade_code()
```
